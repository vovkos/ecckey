Abstract
--------

ECCKey is a command line utility for generating ECC-based product keys (ECC stands for **elliptic curve cryptography**). Here in Tibbo we used it to generate product keys for `IO Ninja <https://ioninja.com>`_; now ECCKey can work a simple ready-to-use generator of product keys for any shareware products of yours.

HOWTO
-----

No documentation, sorry. Please refer to ``main.cpp`` to see how to generate or verify product keys.
